# This script is intended to generate gRPC and protobuf, as well
# as other `*.go` dependencies to provide otherwise autogenerated
# with `ya make` code for linters, test debuggers and other
# development tools
#
# Has to be called time to time to update generated files with
# their newer versions
#
# Usage: just call this script in a folder of a project you want
# to generate dependencies for. This will also create dependencies
# well outside the project scope
#
# The script exploits the fact that arc ignores symlinks
